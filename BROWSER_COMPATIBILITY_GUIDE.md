# Browser Compatibility Guide for DOB Validator

## Overview

The DOB Validator uses the **Bigger Simple Signer** (`https://sign.bigger.systems`) for Stellar wallet connections. This is a trusted, secure wallet connector that operates in a separate window for enhanced security.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Browser Blocking Issues

### Why Browsers Block Wallet Connections

Browser blocking of wallet connectors is **normal and expected behavior** for security reasons:

1. **Popup Blockers**: Modern browsers block popups by default
2. **Cross-Origin Restrictions**: The Simple Signer runs on a different domain
3. **Security Policies**: Browsers restrict external wallet connectors
4. **Privacy Settings**: Enhanced privacy modes block external connections
5. **Extension Interference**: Security extensions may block wallet connections

### Affected Browsers

- **Brave Browser**: Most aggressive blocking (privacy-focused)
- **Chrome/Edge**: Moderate blocking with user controls
- **Firefox**: Moderate blocking with enhanced tracking protection
- **Safari**: Strict popup blocking by default
- **Mobile Browsers**: Often block popups entirely
