# Drafts Functionality Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Data Clearing Issue**

**Problem**: When saving drafts, the form data was getting cleared because the state management wasn't properly handling the save operation.

**Fix**:

- Modified `handleSaveDraft` in `enhanced-device-verification-flow.tsx` to properly update parent state before saving
- Updated all step components to call `updateDeviceData(localData)` before saving drafts
- Added proper error handling and user feedback

### 2. **Backend Schema Mismatch**

**Problem**: The frontend was sending `customDeviceType` which was being filtered out, potentially causing issues.

**Fix**:

- Updated `use-draft.ts` to properly filter out `customDeviceType` before sending to backend
- Ensured all required fields are properly mapped to backend schema
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

### 3. **State Synchronization**

**Problem**: Form components weren't properly syncing their local state with the parent state during save operations.

**Fix**:

- Modified all step components to update parent state before saving
- Added proper state management for draft IDs
- Implemented localStorage persistence for draft IDs

### 4. **API Endpoint Issues**

**Problem**: The draft saving logic wasn't properly handling create vs update operations.

**Fix**:

- Updated `use-draft.ts` to use proper HTTP methods (POST for create, PUT for update)
- Added proper error handling and response parsing
- Ensured draft IDs are properly returned and stored

### Backend (Already Working)

- Backend drafts endpoints are properly implemented
- Database schema is correct
- Authentication and authorization are working

## Testing Instructions

### 1. **Test Draft Creation**

1. Navigate to `/form`
2. Fill out the first step (Device Basic Information)
3. Click "Next" - this should automatically save a draft
4. Check the browser console for draft creation logs
5. Verify that the form data is not cleared

### 2. **Test Draft Updates**

1. Continue filling out the form
2. Navigate between steps - each should save the current progress
3. Check that data persists between steps
4. Verify that the draft is being updated, not recreated

### 3. **Test Draft Loading**

1. Save a draft and note the draft ID from the console
2. Navigate to `/dashboard`
3. Find your draft in the "Incomplete Drafts" section
4. Click "Continue Editing"
5. Verify that the form loads with your saved data

### 4. **Test Draft Deletion**

1. Go to `/dashboard`
2. Find a draft in the "Incomplete Drafts" section
3. Click "Delete"
4. Confirm the deletion
5. Verify the draft is removed from the list

### 5. **Test Form Submission**

1. Complete all steps of the form
2. Submit the form
3. Verify that the draft is converted to a submission
4. Check that the draft is removed from the drafts list

## Debugging

### Console Logs to Watch For

- `üîç Saving draft with ID:` - Shows when draft saving starts
- `üîç Data to save:` - Shows the data being saved
- `üîç Save response:` - Shows the server response
- `‚úÖ Draft saved successfully:` - Confirms successful save
- `‚ùå Error in handleSaveDraft:` - Shows any errors

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"Authorization header required"**
   - Make sure you're logged in with a wallet
   - Check that the auth token is valid

2. **"User not found"**
   - The wallet address isn't registered in the database
   - Try logging out and back in

3. **"Failed to save draft"**
   - Check the backend logs for specific errors
   - Verify the database connection

4. **Form data clearing**
   - Check that `updateDeviceData` is being called before `onSaveDraft`
   - Verify that the step components are properly updating parent state

## Expected Behavior

### After Fixes

- ‚úÖ Form data persists when saving drafts
- ‚úÖ Drafts are properly created and updated
- ‚úÖ Drafts appear in the dashboard
- ‚úÖ Drafts can be edited and deleted
- ‚úÖ Form submission converts drafts to submissions
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling and user feedback

### User Experience

- Users can save progress at any time
- Data is automatically saved between steps
- Drafts are clearly visible in the dashboard
- Users can continue editing from where they left off
- Clear feedback when operations succeed or fail

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fixes** using the testing instructions above
2. **Monitor console logs** for any remaining issues
3. **Test edge cases** like network failures, invalid data, etc.
4. **Consider adding** auto-save indicators and progress tracking
5. **Implement** file upload handling for drafts (currently files need to be re-uploaded)

## Files to Monitor

- Browser console for debugging logs
- Network tab for API requests
- Backend logs for server-side errors
- Database to verify data persistence
